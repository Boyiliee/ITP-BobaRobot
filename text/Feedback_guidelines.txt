If there is any step:

Type 1 - ask a new drink:
Judge if this is the last step, if not the last step, then the customer could add feedback.

Type 2 - interupt with the steps:
Ask to add additional material. For example, add strawberry jam. If in the middle, we may change from `add jam` to `add double jam`.
If in the end, we just add strawberry jam in the end. 

Finally, we could hard code to add straw into the cup.
